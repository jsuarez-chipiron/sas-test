<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><p>Entry restrictions exist for travel to your&nbsp;final destination&nbsp;as well as your transfer airport. You need to inform yourself about, and comply with, these restrictions including those of your transfer airport.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Noncompliance may result in denied travel and/or penalties.&nbsp; All costs that may occur due to denied travel or refused entry are to be paid by the passenger.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please keep yourself updated, as entry restrictions may change on short notice. The latest update can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.flysas.com/en/traffic-information/message/#entry-restrictions" id="LPlnk985648" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://www.flysas.com/en/traffic-information/message/#entry-restrictions</a><br />
<br />
Starting 72 hours before departure you can process your travel documents in our Travel Ready Center, so that you are all set to travel before you get to the airport. Check out our eligible destinations on our website.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please allow for extra time at the airport for control of documents and Travel Requirements.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanking you for your understanding and cooperation.&nbsp;<br />
