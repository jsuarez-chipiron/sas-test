    <!--INSTRUCTIONS
    FOR DESTRUCTIVE CHANGES
    This file will remove the included components
    *AFTER* the deploy.

    For each destructive change, create a new block of changes and create
    a comment header
    for the block including date, author and reason for change. Duplicates of
    type blocks can be
    duplicated in the document. 

    When it is confirmed that an
    included change has been deployed to relevant environments,
    the block can be removed from
    this document.
